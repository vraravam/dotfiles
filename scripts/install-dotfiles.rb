# This script is used to install the dotfiles from this repo/folder structure to the user's home folder
# It can be invoked from any location as long as its in the PATH (and you don't need to specify the fully qualified name while invoking it).
# It can handle nested files.
# If there is already a real file (not a symbolic link), then the script will move that file into this repo, and then create the corresponding symlink. This helps preserve the current settings from the user without forcefully overriding from my repo.
# Special handling (rename + copy instead of symlink) for '.gitattributes' and '.gitignore'
# To run it, just invoke by `install-dotfiles.rb` if this folder is already setup in the PATH

# It assumes the following:
#   1. Ruby language is present in the system prior to this script being run.
